I lead data & decision science at [Mindsets](http://www.mindsetsadvisors.com) - a strategy and decision advisory company. In my spare time, I am exploring how to create an idea marketplace with [Tidai](https://www.ali-tarraf.com/post/2020-11-1-tidai/) and ideating for a better world on [@10ideas\_](http://www.twitter.com/10ideas_). I also started [Rogue AI, a local meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rogue-ai/) to discuss business and technology with the community.

I grew up speaking French in [Kinshasa-Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinshasa) and then moved to [Beirut-Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut) for my education where I learned Arabic and English. Then I worked in manufacturing in [Abidjan, Ivory Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan) and found the courage to start a plastics recycling factory [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana). After that I moved to the USA where I lived in Hoosiers Indiana for my graduate studies and then enjoyed the cheese curds of Wisconsin while improving electric motors & generators efficiencies with [Regal Beloit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_Beloit). My wife and I finally settled in the beautiful [Rogue Valley of Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_Valley) enjoying the magnificent outdoors.

<i className ="fas fa-heart"></i>
I love hiking outdoors ([check my hikes](https://www.alltrails.com/members/ali-tarraf)), reading books ([check what I am reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3865553-ali-tarraf)), making cool videos([check my youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AliTarraf/videos)), deep intellectual discussions, watching movies and building things. I am a big fan of the maker and [Do It Yourself (DIY) movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself). **If you can dream it, I can build it.** Oh, I am also an aspiring private pilot and a [Steve Whittman W10 Tailwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittman_Tailwind) builder.

<i className="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>
I got my MSc in Mechanical Engineering from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu) in 2017 after doing [research in combustion](https://www.ali-tarraf.com/post/projects/2018-07-02-experiments-in-combustion/), and earned my BEng in Mechanical Engineering from the [American University of Beirut](https://aub.edu.lb) in 2009.
