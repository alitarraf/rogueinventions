I lead data & decision science at [Mindsets](http://www.mindsetsadvisors.com) - a strategy and decision advisory company. In my spare time, I am exploring how to create an idea marketplace with [Tidai](https://www.ali-tarraf.com/post/2020-11-1-tidai/) and ideating for a better world on [@10ideas\_](http://www.twitter.com/10ideas_). I also started [Rogue AI, a local meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rogue-ai/) to discuss business and technology with the community.
