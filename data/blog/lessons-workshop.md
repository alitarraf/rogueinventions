I recently gave a 3 hours workshop with the team of Beirut AI exploring how to think about Artificial Intelligence problems from a business perspective. We covered topics like AI in the business world, AI in the Middle East and North Africa, dived into analytical visualization tools such as Microsoft Power BI, and finally solved a consulting business case exercise about a bank marketing campaigns.

Lessons learned on how to prepare for a workshop:

1. Target a balanced audience
2. Limit the scope
3. Limit the number of attendees
4. Manage your time
5. Project and manage your energy
6. Engage your audience
