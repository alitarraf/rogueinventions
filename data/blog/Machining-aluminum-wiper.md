Machining aluminum 6061 for a friend who is working on a metal 3D printer. You got to love the mountain of chips!

Squaring off big parts is always an issue, specially that you have to clamp down the parts and make sure it is aligned with a dial indicator.

I had some issues with my end mill leaving traces on the part face. I should have probably used a different one.

Initial cuts to approximate shape of the wiper.
