Hello world! These are the first words I type on my website.

An online presence is like growing a new limb, or a new external entity attached to you, you feel responsible towards it in terms of taking care of it, at the same time you feel the burden of having to dedicate new ressources towards it. Your digital life starts to demand things from your actual real life because you start thinking in terms of what would be appropriate to show to the world.
Yes, a website is a window to the world where everyone can have a peek at what you allow them to see. The danger arises when your vanity takes over, you start liking too much your audience presence on your window transforming your real life wave into a digital wave as pictured in "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" digital painting.
