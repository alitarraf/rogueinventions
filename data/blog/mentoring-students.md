I taught for 3 academic semesters an introductory course on CAD design using PTC Creo 3.0 for a total of little bit less than 300 students. These are some of the projects that my students designed in CAD and built prototypes using 3D printers. I was fortunate to mentor very smart students with some very interesting solutions to everyday problems as you can see in the slides below.
